# IBM-Data-Science-Capstone
This is the capstone project from the IBM Data Science certification. It uses location data from Foursquare to choose a neighborhood based on local restaurants and plots the results in a Folium map. GitHub does not display Folium maps, so to see the file with the Folium maps, [click here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/QuantumAudio/IBM-Data-Science-Capstone/blob/master/ChoosingNeighborhood.ipynb).
